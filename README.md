Battleship Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic game Battleship. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the player tries to guess the locations of hidden battleships. The objective is to sink all the battleships with as few guesses as possible.

Features:
- Interactive gameplay: The player can input their guesses for row and column to target a specific location on the grid.
- Hit or miss feedback: The player receives immediate feedback on whether their guess was a hit or a miss.
- Grid visualization: The current state of the game grid is displayed after each guess, showing the hits and misses.
- Win/Loss condition: The game ends when the player either sinks all 7 battleships or exceeds 9 misses.
- Input validation: The program validates the user's input to ensure it falls within the acceptable range.

Feel free to clone and modify this code to create your own version of Battleship or use it as a starting point for learning and experimenting with Python.

Have fun playing Battleship!
